== Maps
Use a simple map of the different areas reachable in combat, indicating which lines of movement, sight, and cover are available. The important point is to make the consequences of positioning unambiguous before combat begins, in order to avoid confusion or GM fiat during combat. It's up to you whether you use tokens or minis to indicate where charaters are, or use "theater of the mind".

The example map on the previous page shows the drawing conventions I use. You're welcome to use your own as long as they're consistent and players understand.

The GM decides which areas NPCs are in at the start of combat, the players decide where PCs are, within limits set by the GM.

****
In the example map, the GM might tell PCs they can start in the entrance or alley.
****

=== Movement
Solid lines connecting areas indicate you can both see and move between them.  Moving from one area to an immediately connected area takes one action.

Any number of characters can be in an area, and are assumed to be making small movements within that area during combat.  If you want to indicate a one-way transition between areas (jumping down?) use an arrow. I don't think doors are interesting, but if you do, use a box along the connection and require an action to open / close them.

=== Cover
A solid mark perpendicular to the connection into an area means characters in that area benefit from cover against attacks originating from the other area. If you benefit from cover, you get to choose which die is used for damage and which is used for location, instead of your attacker.

****
A character in the bar would have cover against a shot from the dance floor.  That same character in the bar would not have cover against an attack from the catwalk.
****

Don't consider the attacker's area when determining cover.

****
A character on the dance floor would not have cover against a shot from the bar.
****

When checking for cover along multiple connections, if at least one of the shortest paths has cover, the target benefits from cover.

****
A character in the bar would have cover against a shot from the DJ booth.
****

Only cover marks shown on the map can provide cover, not intervening characters.

Cover applies only to attacks made by characters from other areas. This means it does not apply to melee attacks, nor to ranged attacks within the same area.

=== Range
To make an attack you must be within range of your target. Melee attacks have a range of zero.  Items or abilities that can be used to make ranged attacks will define their usable range.

Count the number of connections on the shortest path between the areas. Characters in your area are at range zero. Characters in an immediately connected area are at range one, two areas away at range two, and so on.

****
The range from the entrance to the dance floor is one. The range from the entrance to the catwalk is two.
****

=== Line of Sight
To make an attack, you must have line of sight to your target.

To determine whether you have line of sight to an area, count the number of cover marks (not including your area) along the shortest path.  If one of the shortest paths crosses two or more cover marks, you don't have line of sight. You always have line of sight to a target in your area, even if there's cover in all directions.

****
A character in the alley has line of sight to the kitchen, but not the bar. A character in the pool tables has line of sight to the bar, but not the kitchen. A character in the DJ booth has line of sight to another character in the DJ booth.
****

Dashed lines connecting areas indicate you can draw line of sight between the areas, but not move directly between them.

****
A character on the catwalk can see someone on the dance floor and vice versa, but can not move directly between them. They would have to move to the DJ booth first.
****

There are no situations where line of sight is one-way, nor where you have line of sight and range but are prevented by the map from attacking. In the rare situation where there shouldn't be line of sight between two areas, but you don't want to add enough cover to prevent it, use a dashed line between the two with an X in the middle to indicate line of sight is blocked.

=== Location of Objectives
If there are places that are important to the scenario (arcane portals that will close?  bombs to defuse? avenues of retreat?) mark them on the map.


== Rounds

Combat is divided into rounds, each of which has the following steps:

  . Initiative
  . First team turn
  .. First team takes actions until they are done
  ... Second team may react to each action
  . Second team turn
  .. Second team takes actions until they are done
  ... First team may react to each action
  . Round ends, repeat

Combat ends when a GM specified objective is met, or when only one team has characters still conscious and in the fight.

== Initiative

Initiative is an opposed roll between the single highest level character from each team. The winner of initiative decides the order teams act in, it doesn't have to be winning team first. 

****
Several rounds into combat, the PCs have been beat up a bit, so their highest level character is at 40. The NPCs are in worse shape, with a highest level of 25.  The PCs roll a 34, the NPCs roll a 62, failing.  The PCs decide to let the NPCs go first, intending to react to their expected attempts at moving to retreat. 
****

There are usually two sides to combat, one team of PCs vs one team of NPCs. If for some reason there are more teams, it's a single multi-way opposed roll between the highest level character from each team, highest roll decides the order all teams act in.

A critical success on initiative is an extra action for the rolling character, a critical failure is a loss of an action. If the NPCs have been wounded in prior rounds and roll a critical failure for initiative, the GM should have them retreat or surrender as appropriate.

If there's a tie for initiative (e.g. both sides fail), initiative stays with the team that had it prior round. If it's the first round the tie goes to the PCs. Similarly, if the order dice are rolled in is important (because one side is *good* at initiative and wants to see what number they're trying to beat), it's decided by who had the initiative prior round, or the PCs for first round.

If there's a tie for which characters are highest level, it's up to that team who rolls. Order of actions within a team's turn is up to that team. If there's a dispute in either case, GM decides.

== Actions

Each character gets one action per round.  Your action may be used to act when it's your team's turn, or used to react when it's another team's turn.  Either case uses your action, you cannot both act and react using a single action.

You must declare that you are reacting before dice are rolled, so give people time to do so on your own actions. You can react at most once per action. You cannot react to a reaction. If you don't use your action during your team's turn, and don't get an opportunity to use it to react, it's wasted.

Act:

  * Attack
  * Move
  * Use or manage items

React:

  * Counterattack (react to Attack)
  * Defend (react to Attack)
  * Intercept (react to Move)

Dropping items currently in your hands or speaking a short sentence doesn't take an action.  Anything more than that does, at the GM's discrection.

If you gain an action from a critical success, you must use it during this round. If you lose an action from a critical failure, and don't have any additional actions this round, you lose it next round. Use a note or token of some kind to remind yourself.

=== Attack

Attacking requires that you are in <<Range>>, have <<Line of Sight>>, and already have in hand any item you're using to attack. Make a roll. On a success, you choose one die for the amount of <<Damage>> your target takes and the other die for <<Hit Location>>.  If the target benefits from <<Cover>>, they get to choose instead.

=== Move

Moving from one area to an immediately connected area takes one action, and doesn't require a roll to succeed.

=== Use or manage items

Rearranging which items are in your hands, including picking items up or stowing away items, takes a total of one action. Using an item already in your hands, or attached to your area on the map (e.g. a lever or terminal), for something other than attack takes one action.

=== Counterattack

In reaction to an attack against you from a character _in your area_, you may use one action to counterattack. This is not an opposed roll, you each make separate rolls as you would for <<Attack>> and apply any effects simultaneously.

You cannot counterattack against an attack targeting someone other than you. You can counterattack _using_ a ranged weapon only if it is effective at range 0. You can counterattack _against_ a ranged attack only if it is from a character in your area, i.e. range 0.

=== Defend

In reaction to an attack against you, you may use one action to defend. This is an opposed roll. If you win, the attack misses and does no damage.

In general, you must spend one action per attack you defend against.

=== Intercept

In reaction to movement within your line of sight and range, you may use one action to <<Attack>> the moving character. Cover from either area does not apply. Use the smaller of the two ranges. A character moving between an area at range one and zero is effectively at range zero, between two and one is at range one, and so on. If the effect of your attack forces them to stop moving, you decide which of the two areas they end up in.

****
The range from the entrance to a character moving between the catwalk and dance floor is one.
****

== Damage

When you are damaged by an attack, reduce your level by the amount of damage and mark the corresponding number of boxes on the hit location section of your character sheet.

Mark damage in empty ‚òê boxes, normally using a \ slash, indicating a wound that may be treatable by <<First Aid>>. A mark of X is used to indicate a wound that cannot be treated by first aid, only by <<Recovery>>. Marking by completely filling a box ‚ñ† is used to indicate a permanent wound that cannot be treated. A box is considered marked if it has any type of mark \, X, or ‚ñ†.

=== Hit Location

The numbers on the die used for hit location correspond to six locations on the body, the higher the number the closer to the head:

[%autowidth]
|===
|9 | Head | ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
|8 | Right Arm | ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
|7 | Left Arm | ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
.3+|4-6 .3+|Torso | ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
                  | ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
                  | ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
.2+|2-3 .2+|Right Leg |  ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
                      |  ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
.2+|0-1 .2+|Left Leg  |  ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
                      |  ‚òê ‚òê ‚òê
|===

When all of the boxes in a location are marked, apply the appropriate penalty for that type of location:

  .. Head: <<Unconsciousness>>
  .. Arm: Drop any item held in that hand. You can't use that hand.
  .. Torso: <<Unconsciousness>>
  .. Leg: Immediately stop moving. You can't use that leg. You cannot move without using 2 empty hands.
  .. Both Legs: Immediately stop moving. You cannot move.

If there's additional damage to that location, either from this attack or a future attack, apply it to the torso.

****
You already had 3 boxes marked \ on your right leg.  You move from the dance floor to the bar. An opponent intercepts and hits you with an attack roll of 24.  They choose 4 damage to location 2 (right leg). You decrease your level by 4. You mark a \ in the remaining 3 boxes in your right leg, and an additional 1 box on your torso. You stop moving, and the opponent chooses the dance floor as the area you stop in.
****

=== First aid

First aid has a range of zero to the character being treated, which can be yourself. First aid requires an appropriate <<items.adoc#_first_aid,first aid item>> in your hand. Spend an action, destroy the item, and roll.

On a success, choose one die for the total number of boxes, and the other die for the number of _additional_ locations beyond one. Erase \ marks from the chosen number of boxes, distributed among at most that many locations. Do not increase level. Replace any remaining \ marks with an X.

****
Your ally has 2 \ marks on their head, and 1 \ on each arm. You succeed at first aid with a roll of 14. You choose 4 boxes and 1 additional location. You erase 2 marks from their head and 1 from their right arm. You can only treat 2 locations, so you replace the left arm mark with an X.
****

On a failure, replace all \ marks with an X.

On a critical failure, instead of losing your next action, replace a number of pre-existing X marks up to the number shown on one of the dice (10 for a roll of 100, 9 for a 99, etc) with a permanent wound ‚ñ†. Location of the permanent wounds is up to the player being treated. Then replace all \ marks with an X, as you would for a normal failure.

****
Your ally has 1 \ mark and 1 X mark on their head and 3 X marks on their right arm.  You critically fail at first aid with a roll of 66. You replace the X marks on their arm and head with ‚ñ† permanent wounds, for a total of 4. Even though that's less than the 6 on the die, there are no more X marks to replace. You then replace the \ mark on their head with an X.
****

=== Unconsciousness

If your level is below 10 or all of your head or torso boxes are marked, you are unconscious. When you are unconscious, you cannot spend actions and none of your abilities have an effect.

=== Death

If your level is below 0 or all of your head or torso boxes are marked with ‚ñ† permanent wounds, you are dead. Make a new character and the GM will help you rejoin the story at the first available opportunity. If you and everyone on your team is unconscious at the end of combat, your fate, potentially including death, is up to the GM.

=== Surrender

You may surrender at any point before an action that would affect you, as long as dice haven't been rolled yet. If you surrender, that action isn't spent and doesn't take effect.  Reduce your level to zero, you are out of the fight and effectively unconscious.

=== Recovery

Once combat is over, you can choose to recover. Recovery allows you to restore your level to max, erase any \ or X wounds, and acquire or replace any items up to your maximum slots. The downside of recovery is that time passes, and any forces opposing you are not idle. The GM will advance the story to reflect this.
