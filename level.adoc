[#level]

= Level

Your level is your basic percentage chance of success when <<dice.adoc#dice,rolling dice>>.  Your current and *max* level start at 50, and are tracked separately on your character sheet.  The word 'level' by itself always refers to current level unless prefixed with *max*.

== Level changes

Your level can decrease when you're hurt and increase when you rest. It can't increase higher than your *max* level. If it reaches zero, you're unconscious.

All players' *max* level increases by 1 at the end of a session if they achieved their goal for that session.
